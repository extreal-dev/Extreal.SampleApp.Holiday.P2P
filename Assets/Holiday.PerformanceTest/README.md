## Performance test (P2P multiplayer)
## Build for performance test
### 1. Add a performance test scene
Have all players operate automatically in the performance test.  
In `Build Settings` - `Scenes in Build`, check `Holiday.PerformanceTest/PerformanceTest` and place it at the top.
### 2. Host/Client Selection
In P2P multiplayer, the automatic operation differs between the host and the client.  
To select which one to operate, use `Role` in `Assets/Holiday.PerformanceTest/PerformanceTestConfig`.
### 3. Exclude VoiceChat.(Dedicated Server Build only)
- Remove "Voice Chat Control" from "StageConfig.asset".
- Comment out the following line from "ClientControlScope.cs".
  ````
  var voiceChatClient = VoiceChatClientProvider.Provide(peerClient, assetHelper.VoiceChatConfig);
  builder.RegisterComponent(voiceChatClient);
  ````
### 6. Build Settings
- All Platform
  - It is recommended to turn on Development Build to reduce build time.
- Windows Dedicated Server (load client)
  - Change Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Optimization > Managed Stripping Level to "Minimal".
