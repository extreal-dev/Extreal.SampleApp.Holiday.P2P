Prepare a Grafana dashboard.
Start Grafana using Docker Compose and use the dashboard with Grafana access in your browser.

1. Start Grafana with Docker Compose.
    ```
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```
1. After a few moments, check to see if the service has started, and if `STATUS` is all `healthy`, it is OK.
    ```
    $ docker-compose ps
    ```
    If any services are `unhealthy`, restart them individually.
    ```
    $ docker-compose restart <<service>>
    ```
1. Access Grafana by specifying `localhost:3000` in your browser.
1. Select `Sign in`.
    - username: `admin`
    - password: `admin`
    - Set a new password for admin.
1. The Grafana home page will appear. Select `Dashboards` from the menu icons on the left.
1. Select `Import` from the New pull-down on the right.
    1. Upload `holiday-dashboard.json` in the same location as this README.
    1. Select `Loki` from the Loki pull-down menu.
    1. Click `Import`.
1. Once the dashboard appears, you are ready to go.
